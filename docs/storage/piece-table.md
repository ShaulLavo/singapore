# Storage Engine: Tree-Backed Piece Table

## Status: Implemented and Proven

The editor's storage engine is a piece table on a persistent AVL tree (a treap until [E040](../performance/e040-balanced-tree.md)) with persistent immutable snapshots via structural sharing. Each mutation returns a new snapshot; previous snapshots remain valid and unmodified.

**Implementation:** `packages/textbuffer/src/`
**Types:** `packages/textbuffer/src/pieceTableTypes.ts`
**Operations:** `packages/textbuffer/src/pieceTable.ts`

## Locked Decisions

- Piece table on a balanced persistent tree as the storage engine
- Persistent (immutable-snapshot) data model for undo
- Opaque buffer identity over an append-only, lineage-shared chunk log with per-snapshot extents
- Buffer chunk storage is exposed as a read-only `get`/`keys`/iterator view at the type boundary; no debug-only accessor layer for now
- UTF-16 code units as the native encoding
- Line-ending normalization to `\n` on load
- Phase 2 deletion keeps invisible pieces in the treap rather than physically removing them

## Capabilities

| Capability            | Complexity   | Notes                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Insert text at offset | O(log n)     | One descent; the landing places the new node and each ancestor rejoins                             |
| Delete text range     | O(log n)     | Current implementation physically removes pieces; Phase 2 changes this to mark pieces invisible    |
| Read text range       | O(log n + k) | Tree walk collecting piece slices                                                                  |
| Snapshot isolation    | O(1)         | Structural sharing; old roots remain valid                                                         |
| Document length       | O(1)         | Cached in the root's `subtreeVisibleLength`                                                        |
| Piece count           | O(1)         | Cached in `subtreePieces` aggregate                                                                |

## The Piece

The editor has one fundamental text-slice record: the **piece**. There is no second slice abstraction. A piece is a descriptor (`buffer`, `start`, `length`) pointing into one of the buffers via a `PieceBufferId`.

A piece's `(buffer, start)` pair serves as its insertion identity — no separate `insertionId` field is needed. The anchor model (see [Anchors](../positions/anchors.md)) builds on this identity without introducing new record types.

## Aggregate Maintenance Pattern (Locked)

All subtree aggregates (`subtreeVisibleLength`, `subtreePieces`, `subtreeLineBreaks`, `subtreeOriginalLength` and the rest) are computed in a single function pattern. `createNode` delegates to aggregate computation; every site that reassigns children recomputes aggregates on the result. There is no separate update that mutates individual fields — partial aggregate updates are structurally impossible. Adding a new aggregate means adding it to the aggregate function and the `PieceTreeNode` type.

## Enrichment Roadmap

**Phase 1 — Line breaks:**

- Piece gains `lineBreaks` field (newline count in its buffer slice)
- Piece gains `firstLineBreak` (E046): the position of its first break in its chunk's line index.
  A chunk only grows at its end, so the position never moves. A cut gives the right part the left
  part's position plus the left part's count, and an appended piece takes the tail's running count
- Treap node gains `subtreeLineBreaks` aggregate
- Enables O(log n) offset-to-row/column conversion

**Phase 2 — Anchor resolution:**

- Treap node gains `subtreeVisibleLength` aggregate, maintained in the shared aggregate function
- Piece gains `visible: boolean`
- Delete marks pieces invisible instead of removing them
- `subtreeVisibleLength` sums only visible pieces and becomes the user-facing document length aggregate

**Future — Collaboration:**

- The Phase 2 visibility model is reused rather than redesigned
- Reverse index keys remain extensible to replica-scoped buffer identity

## Phase 1 Prerequisites

### Opaque BufferId

**Status: complete.** `PieceBufferId` is an opaque branded number.

Phase 2 must continue treating buffer identity as opaque. No string-literal comparisons should be introduced.

### Chunked Append Buffer

**Status: complete.** Inserted text is stored in append chunks shared by a lineage's snapshots through an append-only log. An insert fills the newest chunk before opening another; each `PieceBufferId` names one contiguous span of one chunk, so several ids share a chunk string.

Pieces reference buffer identity plus a range in that chunk. Appending is O(1) on a linear history; a branch that appends after a sibling copies its visible prefix of the log once. See the [E038 report](../performance/e038-append-only-buffer-store.md).

**Alternatives rejected:**

- Single string: O(n) per insertion. Unacceptable.
- Rope: Unnecessary — the piece table already provides the tree structure.
