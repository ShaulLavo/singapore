# E054: the TypeScript worker at language-server parity

Completed 2026-09-25. `@singapore-editor/typescript-lsp` answers every method Platform gets from its
server-side TypeScript backend, loads its standard library without the network, takes project files
one at a time, and reports its own crash the way a server process does. The Editor demo renames
across files, applies a quick fix, formats, and shows an outline with no server running.

## Parity, before and after

`packages/typescript-lsp/test/parity.test.ts` drives one scripted session through the real
`LspClient`: a workspace file, an opened document, an edit, then every row below. A row is
`supported` only when the capability is advertised and the answer carries what the feature needs;
a capability advertised without a row fails the suite. Run against the worker as it stood at
`ed5b2e2`, the same harness produced the left column.

| Method | Before (`ed5b2e2`) | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| hover, definition, references, implementation, typeDefinition | supported | supported |
| completion | supported | supported |
| `completionItem/resolve` | not advertised | supported (detail, documentation, auto-import edits) |
| signatureHelp | not advertised | supported (label offsets, active parameter, rest parameters) |
| documentHighlight | not advertised | supported (read and write kinds) |
| documentSymbol | not advertised | supported (tree in document order, or flat with containers) |
| `workspace/symbol` | not advertised | supported (standard library left out) |
| prepareRename, rename | not advertised | supported (versioned `documentChanges` or a `changes` map) |
| codeAction | not advertised | supported (quick fixes with VS Code's preferred-fix ranking, refactors, organize imports) |
| `codeAction/resolve` | not advertised | supported (refactor edits computed when chosen) |
| formatting, rangeFormatting, onTypeFormatting | not advertised | supported (the request's indentation, the document's line ending) |
| `textDocument/diagnostic` | **advertised, not handled** | supported (`resultId`, `unchanged`, debounced, cancellable) |
| semanticTokens full, range | supported | supported |

A client that declares pull diagnostics is no longer pushed to: every `LspClient` declares it, and
both paths computing the same diagnostics per keystroke was the waste. A document change with more
than one document open sends `workspace/diagnostic/refresh`, so the others are asked again.

Completion used to cut TypeScript's list to its first 100 entries before anything was typed, and
said the list was complete. An auto-import sorts late, so typing more never brought it back. The
typed word now filters first, and a capped list is marked incomplete.

## Where the code is

The worker file is a three-line shim over `src/worker/session.ts`, a server with no transport:
messages in, messages out. Tests drive the session in process (`test/inProcessWorker.ts`) behind
the same `LspWorkerLike` a `Worker` presents, so every suite runs real TypeScript. Each method lives
in its own module under `src/worker/`. `projectHost.ts` replaces `@typescript/vfs`, which is gone:
its update re-parsed the whole file and made every updated file a program root.

## How the worker gets a project's files

Step 4 measured preload against synchronous pull on Platform's `apps/web`
(`tsconfig.app.json`: 9,341 program files, 48 MB of text, 6,260 of the files in `node_modules`),
opening `src/features/git/components/change-file-row.tsx`, in a Bun worker. Reproduce with
`bun bench/fileProvider.ts --project <apps/web> --config tsconfig.app.json --target <file>`.

| Strategy | Latency per host call | First diagnostics | Program files | Host round trips | Worker heap | After 50 external edits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| preload (ideal set, one message) | n/a | 2,758 ms | 9,341 | 0 | 1,117 MB | 306 ms |
| synchronous pull, whole project | 0 ms | 3,196 ms | 9,341 | 40,341 | 1,084 MB | 309 ms |
| synchronous pull, open file's closure | 0 ms | 2,314 ms | 6,207 | 27,181 | 771 MB | 276 ms |
| synchronous pull, whole project | 1 ms | 45,867 ms | 9,341 | 40,341 | 1,076 MB | 371 ms |
| synchronous pull, open file's closure | 1 ms | 31,060 ms | 6,207 | 27,181 | 766 MB | 298 ms |

Synchronous pull blocks once per uncached question, and TypeScript's module resolution asks tens of
thousands of them. At one millisecond each, a cheap local HTTP round trip, first diagnostics take
half a minute or more. It also needs cross-origin isolation. **Preload won** and is what shipped:
the host pushes files, then keeps them current with `editor/typescript/upsertFiles` and
`editor/typescript/deleteFiles` (`upsertWorkspaceFiles` and `deleteWorkspaceFiles` on the plugin).
Each change reaches the program as one versioned file; a tsconfig or package.json rebuilds it. The
plan's stop condition was not reached: 2.8 s to first diagnostics on `apps/web` is usable.

The preload row is preload's best case: the bundle was recorded by building the same program on the
host first, so it holds exactly the files the program reads. A host with no resolver of its own has
to choose that set another way; Platform's server can list it (`tsgo --listFilesOnly`). The worker's
memory is the program's, not the strategy's: about 1.1 GB for the whole of `apps/web`.

## Standard library

The library ships with the package: `src/worker/bundledLibraries.ts` (generated by
`scripts/generate-bundled-libraries.ts`) holds one lazy `?raw` import per `lib.*.d.ts`, built into
a chunk each, and the worker loads only the reference closure of the program's `lib` or default
library: for the default ES2023 target, 67 of the 108 files (2.9 MB) in 10 rounds, one per
reference depth. `createTypeScriptLspPlugin()` therefore works offline with no
options, as the simple API requires. `libraryFiles: 'cdn'` opts into TypeScript's playground copy;
a loader function answers the worker's `editor/typescript/libraryFiles` request for a host that
supplies its own. The generic `serverRequestHandlers` option on `lsp-plugin` carries that request,
through the connection pool too: the first borrower with a handler answers.

## A crash is an exit

`TypeScriptLspWorkerOwner` posts `$/serverExited` (`LSP_SERVER_EXITED` in `@singapore-editor/lsp`)
with the worker's error before it fails the transport, in the same shape Platform's server path
sends as `$/platform/serverExited`. `LspConnection` records the notification and reports the close
that follows as `LspServerExitedError`, once, with status `error`; before, a worker crash reached
`onError` twice and said nothing about why. The WebSocket session in `./server` forwards the
notification to its socket.

## Verification

- `bun run test` in `packages/typescript-lsp`: the parity harness, one test per method in
  `test/methods.test.ts` (shapes and positions in multi-line files), the session's protocol in
  `test/worker.test.ts` (push to a non-pulling client, incremental upsert and delete, tsconfig
  rebuild, host-supplied libraries), `test/libraries.test.ts`.
- `bun run test` in `packages/lsp-plugin`: server-request handlers through the pool, and a close
  after `$/serverExited` reported as that exit.
- `bunx playwright test` in `examples/app`: `fixes, formats, renames across files and outlines with
  no language server`, with the CDN routed to fail.

## Left for later

- Platform adopting the worker (a backend setting, a file provider over Platform's fs routes, and
  its exit constant aligned with `$/serverExited`) is Platform's plan.
- `onTypeFormatting` is answered but no Editor feature asks for it; the Editor's own reindent runs on
  typed closers.
- Refactors that need more input (`isInteractive`) and fix-all source actions are not offered.
- The program's memory is not bounded by the worker.
