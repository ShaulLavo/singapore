# Anchor System

## Semantics (Locked)

- Anchors are stable references into immutable buffers
- Structurally immutable — never change across edits
- Resolved relative to a snapshot
- Always resolve to a document offset
- Deterministic: given (anchor, snapshot), resolution always produces the same offset and liveness
- May refer to live or deleted text
- Deletion changes liveness, not identity
- Liveness determined at resolution time, not creation time
- Bias (left/right) controls boundary behavior at insertion points
- An anchor may be live in one snapshot and deleted in another (e.g., across undo/redo)

### Why anchors (locked rationale)

- Eliminates rebasing at call sites
- Natural fit with piece table's immutable buffer model
- Proven in Zed at scale
- Liveness model gives consumers clear information

### Alternatives evaluated

1. **Explicit rebasing (CodeMirror-style):** Every call site must remember to rebase. Subtle bugs when forgotten.
2. **Interval tree tracking (VS Code-style):** Central maintenance cost and registration overhead.
3. **Offset-only (current state):** Meaningless after any edit.

## Creating Anchors

`anchorAt(snapshot, offset, bias)`:

1. **Validate offset.** Must be at a code-point boundary — rejects mid-surrogate-pair offsets.
2. Walk treap to find containing Piece.
3. Compute buffer-relative offset: `piece.start + (offset - pieceStartInDocument)`.
4. Return `{ buffer: piece.buffer, offset: bufferRelativeOffset, bias }`.

Always creates a real anchor. Never returns sentinels. Callers wanting absolute start/end must use `Anchor.MIN` / `Anchor.MAX` explicitly.

Convenience: `anchorBefore` = left bias, `anchorAfter` = right bias.

### Anchor Bias Is Not Caret Affinity

`AnchorBias` (`left`/`right`) controls how a durable storage position resolves when edits insert or
delete text at its boundary. `SelectionAffinity` (`before`/`after`) controls which painted caret a
selection head owns when one logical offset has multiple visual positions. They are orthogonal: an
anchor can resolve to the same offset while the selection affinity changes, and normalization must
not merge affinity-distinct carets merely because their anchors resolve together. See
[Selections & Undo](../editing/selections-and-undo.md#caret-affinity).

**Reference:** Treap walk and buffer structure in `packages/textbuffer/src/pieceTable.ts`. Piece type in `packages/textbuffer/src/pieceTableTypes.ts`.

## Deletion and Bias Rules (Locked)

Resolution produces `ResolvedAnchor`: `{ offset, liveness }`.

- **Live:** exact visible position. Liveness = `live`.
- **Deleted:** gap where text used to be. Liveness = `deleted`.
- **Bias at gap:** Left = left edge, Right = right edge.
- **Replacement (delete + insert):** delete-first, then insert. Left-biased stays before new text; right-biased stays after.
- **Boundary clamping:** clamps to 0 / document.length at document edges.
- **Deterministic** for a given (anchor, snapshot) pair.
- **Replacement is not a special case.** Fully defined by delete-first + bias.

### Deletion Representation (Locked)

Phase 2 deletes preserve anchor-resolvable identity by keeping deleted pieces in the treap as invisible pieces.

- `Piece` gains `visible: boolean`.
- Delete marks the affected visible pieces invisible instead of physically discarding them.
- User-facing document length and offsets use visible length only.
- `subtreeVisibleLength` becomes the canonical prefix-sum aggregate for document offsets.
- `subtreeLength` remains physical buffer span length for internal traversal/debugging.
- Future collaboration can reuse the same visibility model; no separate deleted-span history index is introduced.

This is required for deleted anchors to resolve deterministically. If deleted pieces were physically removed, the current direct-node reverse-index design would have no snapshot-local place to find the deleted buffer span.

### Boundary Creation (Locked)

When `anchorAt(snapshot, offset, bias)` lands exactly between two visible pieces:

- left bias anchors to the end of the piece on the left
- right bias anchors to the start of the piece on the right
- at document boundaries, real anchors still use real boundary pieces when available
- callers that need absolute document start/end independent of content use `Anchor.MIN` / `Anchor.MAX`

## Resolution Architecture (Locked)

Two persistent structures:

### 1. Persistent reverse index

Persistent balanced BST keyed by piece interval start: `(buffer, piece.start)`. O(log m) predecessor search finds the piece interval covering an anchor's buffer position, including invisible pieces.

Does NOT store document offsets. Answers only: "which piece interval contains this buffer position?"

Persistent via structural sharing (path copying). Each edit produces a new root.

### 2. Enriched persistent treap (prefix sums)

Treap enriched with `subtreeVisibleLength` aggregates, maintained in the same aggregate function as `subtreeLength` (see `packages/textbuffer/src/pieceTable.ts`). For visible pieces it contributes `piece.length`; for invisible pieces it contributes `0`.

Serves as both ordered piece container and prefix-sum structure. No Fenwick tree needed.

**Why Fenwick rejected:** Flat arrays with no structural-sharing seam — incompatible with persistent snapshots. Also duplicates info already in the treap.

### Bridging (locked: direct node reference)

Reverse index stores direct reference to treap node. O(1) bridging. Safe because persistent nodes are immutable.

### Resolution flow

1. If sentinel, return immediately.
2. Reverse index lookup: find covering piece interval.
3. Live visible piece: compute document offset via visible-length prefix sum.
4. Invisible piece: return deleted liveness and apply bias to the nearest visible gap edge via visible-length prefix sums.

## Snapshot Consistency (Locked)

Snapshot = `(treapRoot, reverseIndexRoot)` tuple. Both immutable. Undo/redo = O(1) root swap.

| Structure      | Per-edit cost                      | Memory per delta |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Enriched treap | O(log n) nodes (already happening) | ~64 bytes/node   |
| Reverse index  | O(log m) nodes via path copying    | ~64 bytes/node   |

**GC safety:** Reverse index points to treap nodes reachable from the same snapshot's treap root. Dropping a snapshot drops both roots. **Invariant:** snapshots must be retained/discarded as complete tuples — never expose roots individually.

### Comparing Anchors

`compareAnchors(snapshot, a, b)` resolves both to offsets. Same offset: left bias < right bias.

## Consumer Direction (Locked)

| Consumer                         | Uses anchors?                                |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Selections, folds, widgets       | Yes                                          |
| Layout                           | No (offsets/Points only)                     |
| Dense decorations (syntax, lint) | Coarse only (per-line/region, not per token) |

## What Still Needs Validation

- Write-path overhead constant factor and GC pressure under rapid editing
- Deleted resolution against real editing patterns (delete-and-retype, replace, multi-cursor)
- Debug inspector for opaque anchors
- Memory characteristics of thousands of small anchor objects in GC'd runtime
- Whether Zed model translates to JS (ownership semantics, zero-cost abstractions absent)
