# TODO

The original wishlist. All 22 topics now have scoped proposals in the
[Editor backlog](plans/README.md): 30 plans with dependencies, ownership, and acceptance checks.

> These notes preserve the ideas and their original context. Some missing-feature and performance
> claims below are historical; each plan's **Current code** section records the checked baseline.
> The plans are proposed, with no standalone Editor implementation scheduled by this document.
> Cross-project execution order remains in [Platform's `PLAN.md`](../platform/PLAN.md).

Inspired by [Text Editor Data Structures](https://cdacamar.github.io/data%20structures/algorithms/benchmarking/text%20editors/c++/editor-data-structures/)
(the fredbuf write-up, [repo](https://github.com/cdacamar/fredbuf)) — see also the discussion of
where our persistent treap already differs from its immutable RB tree.

Many items below were mined from a long-form interview with the fredbuf author about Fred, his
closed-source editor built on fredbuf (local clone: `/Users/shaul/Desktop/D/Editors/fredbuf`),
and a second interview with Allen Webster about 4coder and its customization layer (local clone:
`/Users/shaul/Desktop/D/Editors/4coder`). Each item carries enough context to be picked up
without having seen those interviews.

## Visual piece-tree debug tool

A debugging/inspection tool for the piece table, ideally visual (render the treap: node
priorities, piece order keys, visible/invisible pieces, cached subtree sums, the reverse index).
The fredbuf author credits `print_tree`/`print_piece`-style utilities as the reason the project
got finished at all; we currently have no tree printer and no invariant checker in
`packages/textbuffer/src/`.

Scope ideas, smallest first:

- `validatePieceTreeInvariants(snapshot)` — walk the tree and re-derive every cached field
  (subtree lengths, visible lengths, line breaks, min/max order), check in-order `order` is
  ascending, check the reverse index mirrors the tree. Usable as a property check in tests.
- `debugPrintPieceTree(snapshot)` — text dump of tree shape with piece metadata.
- Visual layer on top: render snapshots side by side across undo history, highlight which nodes
  were path-copied by an edit. Would double as a teaching/marketing artifact for the editor.

## Reduce editor memory footprint

Two related fronts:

- **Tombstone accumulation.** Deletes mark pieces `visible: false` and keep them in the treap
  forever (`markTreeInvisible` in `packages/textbuffer/src/tree.ts`). Tree height and
  split/merge cost grow with all-time edit count, not document size — the classic piece-table
  "long edit session" degradation, in log form. Need a churn benchmark first (interleaved
  insert/delete, measure piece count and op latency), then a compaction pass that drops invisible
  pieces once no live history snapshot or anchor can reference them (e.g. when the undo stack is
  trimmed). `normalizePieceOrders` already shows the rebuild-the-world hook pattern.
- **Full-text materialization.** Find, tree-sitter sync, minimap summaries, and LSP all call
  `materializeFullText()`, and `createDocumentTextSnapshot` retains full-text caches — so in
  practice we often hold the entire document as a flat string next to the piece table, doubling
  memory. The piece-walker work (in progress) is the enabler for removing most of these.
- **Look into LSP incremental sync.** Mostly done (June 2026): the dominant fallback was
  deferred syncs batching behind rapid input and losing their edits ('missing-edits' →
  full 48MB sync per typing burst); `DocumentEditChain` (`core/src/editor/editChain.ts`)
  now hands deferred consumers composed base-coordinate edits since any text version, and
  syncs log `snapshot-incremental`. The `fullSnapshotContentChange` fallbacks in
  `packages/lsp/src/positions.ts` remain as the safety net (reasons are recorded via the
  `lsp.contentChanges.path` diagnostic) — fine unless that diagnostic shows them firing.

## Research: SAB-backed SoA piece tree (LMDB-style shared snapshots)

Long-term dream: back the piece tree with a SharedArrayBuffer arena in structure-of-arrays layout
(`left: u32[]`, `right: u32[]`, `pieceStart: u32[]`, subtree sums, `flags: u8[]`, index 0 = null)
so same-cluster workers read the document directly — no descriptors, no chunk shipping.

Why it's sound here: the treap is persistent (path-copying, nodes never mutated), so an
append-only arena + one `Atomics.store` to publish the new root gives wait-free coherent
snapshots to readers with no locks — workers can keep reading an old root while main publishes
new ones. Same architecture as LMDB's copy-on-write B-tree / RCU. `Atomics.waitAsync` gives
push-free freshness.

Constraints learned up front:

- **SAB never crosses a process boundary** (agent cluster only), so SAB cannot be _the_
  foundation — it's a transport tier.
- **Tiers compose per channel, not per deployment.** The Platform app
  (`/Users/shaul/Desktop/D/Platform`) already mixes them in one editor instance: LSP is tier 0
  (WebSocket to `apps/server`'s LSP proxy), minimap and tree-sitter are tier 1 in-browser workers
  (`createTreeSitterWorkerBackend()` in `apps/web/.../editor-plugins.ts`), and tree-sitter could
  move server-side behind its backend interface at any time. Capability (`sharedMemory`) must be
  negotiated per backend channel at handshake; one deployment runs several tiers at once.
- **Tier model**: one logical protocol (immutable snapshots, content-addressed chunks, send-once
  dedup — already transport-agnostic) with three transports: tier 0 remote backend (strings over
  socket/IPC), tier 1 same-cluster workers (structured-clone strings), tier 2 crossOriginIsolated
  channels (SAB arena, shared tree).
- **Decision: tree-sitter stays in-browser (wasm worker) as default.** Context: the product is
  always a local server + UI (Electron bundle, or CLI launching the server + browser UI), so the
  server is loopback — RTT ~0.1–0.5ms, comparable to a worker hop. Per-keystroke latency is
  therefore a tie between wasm-in-worker and native-over-localhost; the call is operational:
  wasm wins on grammar distribution (one platform-independent artifact vs native prebuilds per
  OS/arch/ABI for the CLI) and zero new backend/doc-sync code. Native server tree-sitter wins on
  cold parse (~2–3x), browser-heap relief, and CPU isolation — keep it as a benchmark-gated
  future `TreeSitterBackend` implementation (content sync could piggyback the existing LSP
  `didChange` channel); revisit if cold-parse on realistic large files measurably hurts.
  Consequences: tree-sitter is the flagship tier-2 consumer. We control the serving headers, but
  tier 2 is still strictly opportunistic, never assumed: the UI must run in arbitrary user
  browsers (CLI mode opens the default browser; capability floor includes old/locked-down
  engines, and growable SAB is newer than base SAB), and COOP/COEP has collateral even where
  supported (every subresource needs CORP/CORS; COOP severs window.opener and breaks OAuth
  popups). Tier 1 is the contract; tier 2 upgrades per session/channel when the handshake allows.
- **The walker is the seam**: `PieceTableWalker` is storage-blind. Tier 0/1 workers implement it
  over decoded chunk caches; tier 2 over the SAB arena; consumers (tree-sitter callback, diff,
  future find/minimap) never know which tier they're on.
- **JS string tax**: no string views over external memory — every consumer needing a real
  `string` pays a decode (`String.fromCharCode`) into a worker-local cache. SAB removes transfer
  and protocol, never decode.
- **Today's `shared-utf16` chunk path is dead code in practice**: no deployment sets COOP/COEP
  (Platform app has none → `crossOriginIsolated` false), it re-decodes on every read
  (`readUtf16Text` in `packages/tree-sitter/src/treeSitter/source.ts`), and the encode side is a
  per-char JS loop. Bench string `slice` vs SAB decode and `structuredClone` vs manual fill —
  the same numbers price tier 2's read path — then either delete `shared-utf16` or convert it to
  decode-once-and-cache. Per-message SAB transport and tier-2 storage-layer sharing are separate
  decisions; killing the first does not touch the second.

Evidence from the June 2026 typing-latency hunt (1M-line / 48MB fixture, Chromium):

- The tree itself is not the main-thread cost: full treap edit (`editor.view.applyEdit`)
  held at ~0.6ms/keystroke through every profile and never appeared as a hot leaf. Every
  real win was O(document) work _around_ the tree (line-break scans, snapshot lineStarts
  rebuilds, full-text materialization, message payloads). Step 1 below is therefore
  justified as the tier-2 prerequisite, not as a standalone perf win.
- Message-passing priced: one ±250k-char tree-sitter refresh ships ~193k tokens + 34k
  brackets (`treeSitter.parseResult.payload` diagnostic). As object arrays that cost
  ~97ms/20-keystrokes of main-thread deserialize + ~305ms GC; packed SoA + transferables
  (`core/src/syntax/packedTokens.ts`) cut that to 12ms + 40ms. The residual is the
  client-side unpack into 193k `EditorToken` objects + merge — exactly the part tier-2
  shared results (or an SoA in-memory token model with lazy views) would delete.
- New primitives that slot into the plan: `DocumentEditChain` (tier-1 chunk-mirror sync is
  now built, not hypothetical), per-buffer `\n` offset indexes
  (`pieceTable/buffers.ts` `lineIndexes` — an SoA sidecar the arena design must carry or
  workers rebuild), and `LineStartsView` (snapshots expose base + suffix-delta line
  starts instead of materialized arrays; minimap/LSP/scope-lines consume the view).
- Worker-copy staleness is the recurring bug factory: the LSP full-sync regression, the
  minimap baseline drift (its structural-scan skip silently never fired because the
  baseline was post-edit state), and the edit chain itself all exist only because workers
  synchronize copies via messages. Tier 2 deletes the bug class, not just the copy cost.

Stepping stones (each independently justified):

0. **SAB hash map (the toolkit proving ground).** Open-addressing map over typed-array
   views: `Uint32Array` key/value cells, insert via `Atomics.compareExchange` slot claim,
   resize by publishing a new table root, string keys as `{offset, len}` into a bump/
   freelist allocator with byte-compare on probe. It is the arena project minus tree
   invariants and minus persistence — the cheapest way to build and battle-test the whole
   SAB toolkit (allocator, atomics discipline, epoch reclamation, growable-SAB handling,
   cross-worker test harness) before the piece tree depends on it. First consumer already
   named in the tier model: the content-addressed chunk dedup table
   (`hash(chunk) → { sabOffset, length, refcount }`); second: cross-worker style/string
   interning. Guardrail: main-thread-only tables stay plain `Map` — the SAB map only pays
   when one table is read from multiple threads.
1. SoA-ify the tree behind the existing API — prerequisite for the arena; do not expect a
   measurable main-thread win on its own (the treap held ~0.6ms/keystroke at 1M lines).
2. Epoch-based reclamation — already wanted for tombstone compaction; becomes the arena GC
   (workers advertise oldest held root; recycle nodes unreachable from anything older).
3. SAB arena + atomic root publish — tier-2-only storage backend swap at the end.
4. **Worker-parallel find-all (the payoff consumer).** Fred-style: chunk the document by line
   ranges, fan the _same immutable snapshot_ out to N workers (tier 1: chunk mirrors kept in
   sync via the now-existing `DocumentEditChain`; tier 2: read the SAB root directly), each worker searches its
   chunks and streams matches back through a results queue so the UI renders matches + a
   progress bar incrementally; cancellation via a shared flag/epoch workers poll between
   chunks. Persistence makes this lock-free by construction — a worker can never observe a
   mutation, only an older root. Fred details worth copying: the main/UI thread participates
   in the search with roughly a 2x share of the work (it would otherwise idle waiting to
   join), and per-worker timing is surfaced in its debug overlay (his numbers: ~23ms over a
   20MB/636k-line file, debug build). Extends naturally from one buffer to cross-file find-all
   over a chosen root directory. Single-threaded in-buffer find improvements are a separate
   TODO ("Faster in-buffer find"); this item is strictly the parallel/multi-file tier.

## Undo history as a graph (never lose an edit state)

The fredbuf trick, condensed: with append-only text buffers and a path-copying (persistent)
piece tree, every edit already produces a brand-new root while old roots stay valid forever —
so keeping _all_ history is just not dropping old root pointers. fredbuf's undo entry is
literally `{ tree root, edit offset }` (`fredbuf.h:21` in the local clone), i.e. "every edit is
two pointers big"; Fred builds its branching history graph in the editor layer on top of the
buffer's `commit_head()/head()/snap_to()` primitives, and undo/redo just swap which root is
current.

We already have every prerequisite: a persistent path-copying treap
(`packages/textbuffer/src/tree.ts`), append-only buffers
(`packages/textbuffer/src/buffers.ts`), O(1) snapshots, and
`packages/editor/src/history.ts` storing `{ snapshot, selections, transaction }` per entry in
persistent stacks, with typing-run coalescing (`amendEditorHistory` + `shouldAmendTypingRun` in
`documentSession.ts`). The single flaw: `commitEditorHistory` (`history.ts`, the `redo: null`)
discards the redo branch on every new commit — editing after an undo orphans the abandoned
states, exactly the behavior Fred was built to escape.

Change: replace the twin undo/redo stacks with a tree.
`HistoryNode { snapshot, selections, transaction, parent, children[], createdAt }` plus a
`current` pointer. Undo = move to `parent`; redo = move to the most-recently-created child
(plain linear undo/redo UX is unchanged); commit = append a child and **never delete
siblings**; amend (typing coalescing) = update `current` in place, as today.
`DocumentSession` is the only consumer (`packages/editor/src/documentSession.ts` ~406–435
undo/redo, ~495–549 commit paths). Memory cost is identical per edit (structural sharing; GC
reclaims what no root references) — abandoned branches add a few pointers each. Optional
safety valve: cap node count and prune oldest leaves.

Sub-TODO — persist history across sessions: each node already stores a `DocumentTransaction`;
serialize the tree as transactions + parent links and replay on open (Fred's planned approach
too). Needs an integrity check (content hash) since the file can change on disk outside the
editor.

## Undo graph widget (Fred-style time-travel UI)

Depends on "Undo history as a graph" above. A panel rendering the history tree as a node graph
with visible branches — Fred's marquee feature (Ctrl+Shift+Z):

- Click any node → jump the document to that state (snapshot swap via `DocumentSession`;
  selections are stored per node, so cursors restore as part of the jump).
- Walking nodes shows the diff for each step; selecting any **two** nodes — including across
  branches — shows the diff between them. All diffs are computed on demand by walking the two
  snapshots and are never stored: any two states are just two roots over shared buffers.
- Parent↔child pairs: `diffPieceTableSnapshots` (`packages/textbuffer/src/diff.ts`)
  already computes the minimal single edit without materializing either document — exactly
  right for per-step display.
- Arbitrary pairs need a real line-level diff (Myers or histogram over line hashes, ~100 lines
  of code). `packages/diff` already renders hunks (`editorDiffPlugin.ts`, `model.ts`) — only the
  compute step is missing. Pull line text through the piece walker to keep avoiding full
  materialization.
- Label nodes with the transaction metadata we already record (source, timestamp). Far-future
  extra from Fred's own wishlist: merge two nodes into a combined state.

## Faster in-buffer find (single-threaded)

Current state: `packages/find/src/search.ts` matches with `RegExp.exec`/`String.indexOf` over
`host.materializeFullText()` (`packages/find/src/findController.ts`) — every search
materializes the whole document (also flagged under "Reduce editor memory footprint") and runs
on the main thread.

- Benchmark first, on the stress fixtures (see "Standing stress fixtures" below): literal +
  regex find on a ~600k-line file, warm and cold.
- Research pass, then pick: Boyer–Moore–Horspool (Fred's matcher; skips by needle length) vs
  V8's `indexOf` (native SIMD — beating it from JS is not a given; measure, don't assume).
  The regex path likely stays `RegExp` but can run per-chunk with overlap.
- Search over piece-walker chunks (`createPieceTableWalker`) instead of one giant string,
  handling matches that straddle chunks (overlap window = needle length − 1). Keeps memory
  flat and works on any historical snapshot.
- Case-insensitive matching without lowercasing the entire document (per-chunk folding inside
  the matcher).
- Incremental re-search on edit: the edit chain (incremental document sync work) yields exact
  dirty ranges — rescan only affected spans plus a match-length margin, not the whole buffer.
- UX bar from Fred: _every_ match found and highlighted instantly as you type the query (not
  first-match-then-enter-enter), with a live match count.

Scope note: single-threaded and single-buffer only. Worker-parallel and cross-file find-all
live in the SAB TODO, stepping stone 4.

## Input latency as an enforced budget

Implemented by E002 on 2026-09-07. The [measurement reference](docs/performance/input-latency.md)
defines the synchronous input path, deferred-work ownership, and separate dispatch, frame, and
paint observations. The browser suite covers typing, repeat, composition updates and commits,
paste, and undo across ordinary, 500,000-line, and one-megabyte-line documents and multiple views.

The [recorded local gate](examples/stress/results/input-latency/README.md) accepts an independent
unchanged run and rejects a real 20 ms delay in all 36 synchronous input groups. Range indexing
removes the measured whole-source scan from large-file paste. Document-generation checks prevent
pending secondary work from reaching a replacement document.

Mounted geometry buffers now scale with visible parts, and same-window chunk reuse avoids replacing
simple text nodes. The optimized candidate passes 108 blocking limits; screenshot durations remain
advisory. The recorded reference compares isolated builds and preserves earlier failures.

The instrumentation panel remains E023. A universal 4 ms warning is not established by this
machine-specific calibration; the results state the browser, workload, and IME emulation limits.

## Look into: windowed/streamed loading for massive files

Maybe-future. A 48MB document currently flows whole through every layer: one `fs.read`
returns the full text, the piece table holds it, and the tree-sitter structural parse
covers the entire document — which sits right at the WASM memory ceiling (a single
duplicated parse request was enough to tip `parse root` into `Aborted()` during the
June 2026 StrictMode-leak hunt; the worker parse dedupe made it survivable, not
comfortable). Two candidate directions, possibly combined:

- Sliding-window document view: the frontend never materializes massive files whole.
  Stream the file in ranges and keep a window (plus margins) resident; the piece table,
  syntax, LSP sync, and minimap all operate on the window. Big design lift: offsets
  become window-relative, cross-window edits and search need a spill path.
- Capped structural parse: keep whole-file text but bound the tree-sitter parse to a
  window around the viewport (the token query machinery is already windowed via
  `VISIBLE_SYNTAX_*_CHARS`); reparse on window moves like the prefetch path does.
  Much cheaper to ship, doesn't fix memory for the text itself.

## Look into: render nothing at zero-height viewports

Possible optimization, needs investigation. A virtualized view whose scroll element measures
`viewportHeight === 0` still mounts rows and registers token highlight ranges:
`computeFixedRowVisibleRange` clamps the visible range to at least one row
(`packages/editor/src/virtualization/fixedRowVirtualizer.ts`, the `Math.max(start + 1, rawEnd)`
clamp) and `DEFAULT_OVERSCAN = 12` extends it, so a 0-sized editor mounts 13 rows of real text
and pushes their ranges into the shared `editor-shared-token-*` highlight registry. Observed
2026-06-11 in the platform app, where keep-alive `display:none` tabs each held 13 rows / 32–47
ranges (host-side lifecycle tracked in the platform repo:
`docs/editor-tab-lifecycle-performance.md`).

The optimization: at zero height, mount no rows, register no highlight ranges, skip token
reconcile; cold-mount normally on the first nonzero measure.

Before changing anything, find out why the ≥1-row clamp exists — likely some consumer needs one
mounted row (font-metrics bootstrapping?). If so, satisfy that need explicitly rather than via
the clamp.

## Cursor position navigation history (alt+left / alt+right)

Not covered by edit history: `history.ts` stores selections per _edit_, so undo restores
cursors at edit boundaries — but pure navigation (a click somewhere far, goto-line, find jump,
go-to-definition) creates no entry. Fred keeps a per-buffer trail of cursor positions you can
walk back/forward through; cheap to build, used constantly.

- Record a waypoint on "jumps" only (cause-based: mouse click, goto-line, find jump, goto-def —
  or a distance heuristic like >10 lines), dedupe adjacent waypoints, ring buffer (~128) per
  document view.
- Store anchors, not offsets (`packages/textbuffer/src/anchors.ts`), so waypoints
  survive edits; resolve at jump time and drop dead ones.
- Browser back/forward semantics per pane: walking back and then jumping somewhere new
  truncates the forward tail.

## Copy selection as styled HTML

Fred attaches a `text/html` clipboard flavor carrying the syntax colors, so pasting into
Gmail/Docs/Slack keeps highlighting. Small feature, outsized delight — and nearly free for us
since highlight tokens already exist.

- On copy, build inline-styled HTML for the selected range from the token stream
  (`packages/editor/src/tokens.ts` / shiki pipeline): `<pre>` + spans with explicit inline
  `color`/font styles — no classes, paste targets strip stylesheets. Write a `ClipboardItem`
  with both `text/plain` and `text/html`; the copy command runs inside a user gesture so
  `navigator.clipboard.write` is permitted.
- Fred lesson: dark-theme colors look terrible pasted onto white. Emit a light theme by
  default (or a setting: current/light/dark) regardless of the editor's theme.
- Multicursor: mirror plain-text copy semantics (per-selection blocks joined with newlines).

## Dev instrumentation panel (ship the debug tooling)

Fred ships its debug surface _to users_: a fuzzy-searchable config/debug-flag explorer, live
per-thread search timings, an FPS overlay, and an arena tracker showing each subsystem's peak
memory with click-to-jump-to-the-allocating-line. The habit to copy: instrumentation is a
first-class, always-one-keystroke-away widget, not scattered logs. We already do some of this —
consolidate and expand:

- One fuzzy-searchable panel toggling debug flags at runtime (`packages/editor/src/debug.ts`
  is the seed; flags currently live as scattered consts).
- Frame/paint timing and input→paint latency (feeds the input-latency budget TODO).
- Retained-memory estimates per subsystem: piece table (buffer bytes, live vs tombstone piece
  counts — numbers "Reduce editor memory footprint" needs anyway), tree-sitter trees, minimap,
  LSP caches.
- Search/highlight timing breakdowns when those run.

Related: "Visual piece-tree debug tool" above is the deep inspector for one subsystem; this is
the shallow always-on dashboard.

## Tree-sitter syntax tree inspector (with a Zed comparison step)

Fred binds F11 to a panel showing the live tree-sitter parse tree of the current buffer and
uses it to debug highlight queries. We have the parse infra (`packages/tree-sitter`, worker
backend; `packages/editor/src/syntax`); the inspector is mostly UI:

- Panel of nodes (kind, byte/point range, named vs anonymous, error/missing flags),
  live-updating from the existing incremental parses.
- Two-way sync: cursor move highlights the node path to root; clicking a node selects its
  range in the editor.
- **Step 1 — Zed comparison:** Zed is open source and ships `debug: open syntax tree`
  (github.com/zed-industries/zed). Study its UX and implementation (selection sync, how it
  handles huge trees without rendering everything) plus the tree-sitter web playground, and
  write up findings before designing ours.
- Payoff beyond query debugging: groundwork for tree-sitter-driven go-to-definition (Fred's
  plan: most go-to-def only needs syntactic info, no LSP).

## Standing stress fixtures + interactive benchmarks

Fred's habit: keep absurd files around (a 636k-line / ~20MB C file, a Unicode stress file) and
routinely jump to line 500k, search, and edit — in debug builds — so regressions are _felt_
immediately. We already work this way ad hoc; make it repeatable:

- `scripts/` generator or fetcher for fixtures: huge real-code file (500k+ lines), a
  pathological single long line, Unicode-heavy text, CRLF/LF mixes.
- Scripted scenarios with numbers recorded in-repo so perf shifts show up in diffs: open →
  first paint, goto-line 500k, typing burst, find-all of a frequent token, full scroll sweep.
- Reuse the harness for the churn benchmark "Reduce editor memory footprint" wants and the
  cold-start measurement "Defer startup work" wants; exercises
  `packages/editor/src/virtualization/` where scroll stalls were just fixed (commit 824e4cb).

## File explorer: flattened view

Fred's explorer has an "anchor" toggle that flattens everything under a chosen root into one
fuzzy-filterable list of files — salvaged from three failed project-system attempts and kept
because it's independently useful with no project concept required. The same anchored root
later defines the file set for cross-file find-all (SAB TODO, stepping stone 4).

This repo has no explorer package — the explorer lives app-side (Platform repo,
`/Users/shaul/Desktop/D/Platform`), so implementation likely lands there with any reusable
fuzzy-list widget extracted here. Recorded here so it travels with the rest of the Fred notes.

## Plugin system: study Fred's runtime-compiled plugin model

Background (self-contained, since Fred is closed-source): Fred is the editor built by the
fredbuf author. A Fred plugin is a single C file that the _running editor_ compiles with an
embedded Tiny C Compiler (TCC) in ~1ms into an in-memory executable code page — no DLLs, no
restart; you recompile and rebind from the command palette while the target buffer stays open.
Plugins get the full editor C API, deliberately unsandboxed (local trusted code). The API
surface is generated from one declarative `.dat` file via X-macros, so the dispatch table,
TCC symbol registration, and docs can never drift apart. Capabilities a plugin gets: register
editor commands with a UI name + description (surfaced in the command palette, bindable to
hotkeys, resolved by C function name via `TCC get symbol`), a batch-edit API where one batch =
one undo point, per-cursor access so a command can act on individual multicursors (e.g. the
community "align cursors with spaces" plugin), message-feed notifications, and scratch memory
arenas. Power users stripped his helper layer and pulled in their own C libraries — the plugin
file is just C.

Ours today: compile-time plugin modules wired at build (`packages/editor/src/plugins.ts`;
examples: `packages/find/src/plugin.ts`, `packages/lsp-plugin`,
`packages/diff/src/editorDiffPlugin.ts`, `packages/editor/src/mergeConflictPlugin.ts`). There
is no user-authored runtime plugin story.

The TODO is a design doc, not code:

- Gap analysis against the Fred capability list: command registration with palette metadata,
  keybinding registration, batch edits guaranteed to be a single undo entry, per-selection/
  multicursor operations, snapshot + walker reads, notifications, panel/widget contribution.
  Which does our internal plugin interface already expose? Which are missing or implicit?
- Pick the TS analog of "TCC": dynamic `import()` of user ESM from a config dir with file
  watching for hot reload, vs bundling esbuild-wasm to compile user TS in-editor in
  milliseconds (closest to Fred's instant feel). Deployment is a local server + browser UI,
  so loading local user code is natural; the sandboxing stance can match Fred's (trusted
  local code) — but document that decision explicitly.
- Define the stability boundary (public plugin API vs internals), taking Fred's lesson:
  generate bindings/docs from one source of truth so they cannot drift.

## Defer startup work off the first-paint path

Fred starts about as fast as Notepad _in a debug build_ by pushing every initialization it can
onto background threads (a trick credited to File Pilot) — only window/GL setup stays on the
critical path. Our translation: first paint needs only plain text + layout.

- Audit editor mount → first visible text for synchronous work; paint unstyled virtualized
  lines immediately and enhance in place as subsystems come online.
- Lazy-attach everything else: tree-sitter wasm fetch/compile, LSP connect, minimap worker
  spawn, shiki/theme load — none may gate first paint; each upgrades the view when ready.
- Watch for dynamic-import waterfalls at mount.
- Measure cold start in the benchmark harness (see "Standing stress fixtures").

## Command metadata: single source of truth

4coder lesson. Its commands are declared at the definition site as `CUSTOM_COMMAND_SIG(name)` +
`CUSTOM_DOC("...")`, and a metadata generator parses the source into a table of
`{ fn, name, doc, source file, line }` (`custom/generated/command_metadata.h` in the local
clone) that powers the in-editor command lister and the docs site. The author calls redundant
metadata systems the thing that wore him down — he built two or three of them — and the
committed generated file still contains `C:\4ed\...` absolute paths from his machine, a fossil
of exactly that maintenance pain. The rule worth keeping: a command's name, documentation, and
default bindings live in _one_ declaration next to its code; everything else is derived.

Our gap: `packages/editor/src/editor/commands.ts` is a bare string-union `EditorCommandId` — no
titles, descriptions, or categories anywhere; handlers are wired separately (command router),
keybindings separately (`packages/editor/src/editor/keymap.ts`). Adding a command touches
several files, and a future command palette would need yet another parallel list.

Change: one declaration per command — `{ id, title, doc, category?, defaultBindings, handler }`
— in a single registry; derive the `EditorCommandId` type from it (`as const` + `keyof`) so
type strictness is kept, and derive palette entries, docs, and keybinding-conflict UI from the
same table. No codegen needed: 4coder's generator pass exists only because C cannot iterate its
own globals — in TS the "metaprogram" is an object in a Map. Plugins contribute commands
through the same declaration shape (see the "Plugin system" TODO).

## Editor hook taxonomy: inventory and completeness check

4coder lesson. Its entire default editor behavior hangs off ~15 named hooks (grep
`set_custom_hook` in the local clone's `custom/` layer): layout, per-view render, whole-screen
render, the per-view input handler itself, tick, scroll-animation delta rule, begin/end buffer,
save, edit-range, new-file, buffer-name resolver, view-change. Two standouts:
`HookID_ViewEventHandler` — the _entire per-view input loop_ is replaceable customization code,
which is what makes deep emulation (vim) possible at all — and `HookID_DeltaRule` — the
scroll/cursor animation curve is a tiny pluggable strategy function (`fixed_time_cubic_delta`).
A small, explicitly named, complete hook set is the backbone of a customization layer.

The TODO (feeds the "Plugin system" design doc): inventory our actual extension points — plugin
surface (`packages/editor/src/plugins.ts`, `pluginLifecycle`), command router, display
projection registry, syntax provider sessions, save/load paths — name each
one, and run a completeness check against the 4coder list: layout/display projection, render
decoration, input/keymap pipeline, tick/frame, scroll animation curve, buffer lifecycle
(open/close/save/edit-range), view lifecycle. Decide per hook: public plugin API vs
internal-only. The input pipeline deserves special attention — make it wrappable (a default
handler a plugin can decorate or replace) rather than hardcoded.

## Stress-test the input/command substrate with a modal (vim) layer

4coder lesson. Substrate assumptions bake in silently: its customization layer was shaped by
emacs-style habits, and vim-style emulation turned out much harder to build on it than
emacs-style behavior. Fred avoided this by making vim motions + multicursor first-class from
day one. Cheapest insurance: build a modal layer _early_, while assumptions are still cheap to
fix. The point is not shipping vim — a modal layer exercises everything a non-modal one never
touches:

- Mode state in the input pipeline (`packages/editor/src/editor/input.ts`, `inputState.ts`,
  `keymap.ts`) — can a binding set switch keymaps per mode?
- Key _sequences_ and operator-pending states (`d` → `i` → `w`), counts, and commands
  parameterized by them — does our command shape allow arguments beyond "function over editor
  context", and can commands compose?
- Per-mode cursor rendering (block vs bar) and selection semantics.

Deliverable: a minimal modal binding set (normal/insert modes, a handful of motions and
operators composed from existing commands) written as if by a third party against the
plugin/keybinding API, plus a list of every place the substrate fought back. Run this before
the plugin API is declared stable.

## Compact blank lines (display-time)

4coder ships layout as pluggable variants, one of which — `layout_unwrapped_small_blank_lines`
— renders blank lines at roughly half height: more code on screen, file untouched.
Display-only, cheap, surprisingly pleasant.

Ours would be an opt-in display option rendering empty (or whitespace-only) lines at a fraction
of the line height. Reality check first: text rows go through `fixedRowVirtualizer`
(`packages/editor/src/virtualization/`), which defaults text rows to uniform heights. The retained
row-height index has no live variable-height producer. So step 1 is feasibility: can the virtualizer
take a per-row height exception cheaply, or is the compact look better faked (same logical row
height, squashed visual line-box)? Then: point mapping through wrapping and the display-transform
stack, cursor rendering on a compact line, and whether the minimap mirrors the compaction. Doubles
as a proof that the display pipeline can handle per-row height variation — the same muscle future
layout variants will need.

## Hot/cold data structure vocabulary

Adopt Allen Webster's framing as project terminology (an ARCHITECTURE.md section; mostly
writing, no code). **Cold** = serialized, position-independent encodings where the byte
sequence alone carries the meaning — safe to copy, store, and hand across process boundaries.
**Hot** = pointer-rich runtime encodings of the _same information_, tuned for fast
mutation/query, meaningless outside their process. Programs constantly translate between the
two; being explicit about which side a structure lives on (and where the translations happen)
sharpens design discussions — e.g. it cleanly explains why history persistence should serialize
_transactions_ (cold) and replay them into snapshots (hot) rather than dumping the tree.

The write-up: define the terms and inventory ours — cold: file text on disk, serialized
session/workspace state, the planned history-persistence format (transactions + parent links),
LSP wire messages, structured-clone worker payloads; hot: piece-tree snapshots and the reverse
index, buffer line indexes, anchors, tree-sitter trees, worker-side chunk mirrors. Note the
translation points (open/save, edit-chain worker sync, future history replay) and use the
vocabulary in future TODOs and docs.

## Packed tokens end to end (drop the per-edit unpack)

Context, 2026-09-13. Two fixes removed most of the per-keystroke token cost on large files:
the Shiki worker answers an edit with the re-tokenized lines only (`patchesPacked`, each carrying
the character range it replaced), and the highlighter session splices them into the packed
`Uint32Array` tokens it kept from the open (`splicePackedEditorTokens`). Measured on 100k lines /
500k tokens: the worker's whole-document pack went from 53 ms to nothing and the transfer from
6 MB to 60 bytes per edit; the splice is 1 ms.

What is left is `unpackEditorTokens`: every result is still turned into a flat `EditorToken[]` of
500k objects (about 4 ms under JavaScriptCore, more under V8, plus garbage) because
`EditorHighlightResult.tokens` and everything downstream (`setTokens`, `adoptTokens`, the
`tokens` field of the view snapshot, `mergeSyntaxRangeTokens`, the minimap's token source, the
semantic token layer) are written against the object array. That is the last per-edit cost that
scales with document size rather than with the edit.

Suggested change:

- Make the packed form the token store. Keep `starts`/`ends`/`styleIds` typed arrays plus the
  palette as the canonical document tokens and give consumers a small read API: token at index,
  first token at or after an offset (the binary search the splice already uses), and a row slice.
  `unpackEditorTokens` becomes a compatibility path for callers that genuinely need objects.
- Move the highlighter contract to it: `EditorHighlightResult.tokens` becomes the packed store
  (or a patch plus the store), and `setTokens` / `adoptTokens` accept it directly, so a keystroke
  costs one splice and no allocation proportional to the document.
- Route the tree-sitter and semantic-token paths through the same store; `mergeSyntaxRangeTokens`
  and `projectSyntaxRangeCache` currently rebuild object arrays for the same reason.
- Keep the row painter on slices: it already reads by offset range, so it should never need the
  whole array materialised.

Acceptance: an edit in a 500,000-line document allocates no token objects outside the edited rows,
and the input-latency gate's paste and undo groups do not regress. The Shiki worker, splice, and
browser tests from the same-day change stay as they are; they already assert a spliced answer
equals a fresh full tokenization.

## Workaround audit: ask the owner, do not model it

Added 2026-09-21. Platform's diff line-comment layer found the clicked row by reading
`data-editor-virtual-row` off the editor's DOM, treated that display-row index as a buffer row, and
the diff package carried a runtime guard only to warn when the assumption broke. One small API
(`diffRowAtEvent`) replaced all of it. A read-only audit of the plugins and the core the same day
found the shape again:

- a plugin or host reverse-engineering the core's DOM or row geometry instead of asking;
- a display row used where a document line is meant (the minimap);
- a miss answered with a quiet default instead of an error;
- obligations every host must remember (`setTokens` after each `setText`, listener order, CSS
  overrides) where the API should do the work;
- fast paths with no test pinning them to the slow path they replace.

Each is a backlog entry (E047 to E051). Platform's halves are Platform plans 130 to 133.

## Edit commands without a whole-document string

Left over from E033. Edit actions (delete/move/copy/join/sort lines, comment toggles, indent,
case transforms, trim trailing whitespace) and the exact-occurrence commands (Ctrl+D, select all
occurrences, cut of whole lines) still take the document as one string. They reach it through
`commandDocumentText` in `packages/editor/src/editor/inputSelectionController.ts`, which is
allowlisted in `scripts/full-text-boundary-allow.json`. Each run costs a full copy of the
document; on a 48M-unit file that is tens of milliseconds per keypress of these commands.

Most of them only need the lines around the selections: `createLineMap` and `applyTextEdits` in
`packages/editor/src/editor/editActions.ts`, and the `indexOf` scans in `occurrences.ts`. Move them
onto `TextReadSnapshot` line queries and bounded reads, like selection expansion and ghost text
after E033. Occurrence search can scan chunks forward from the selection. Trim trailing whitespace
is genuinely whole-document and can walk chunks. Once no caller is left, delete
`commandDocumentText` and its allowlist entry, so `check:full-text` keeps it gone.

## Proportional fonts: wrap and horizontal extent from measured advances

Added 2026-09-24, from E036. A proportional editor font now places clicks and carets correctly,
because rows whose font fails the monospace check are measured in the DOM. Everything the view
estimates before a row is measured still multiplies a column count by one character width: soft
wrap breaks, the left spacer of windowed long rows, and the horizontal scroll width. Measure glyph
advances once per face and use them on those paths when the font is not monospace, without
costing monospace fonts anything.
