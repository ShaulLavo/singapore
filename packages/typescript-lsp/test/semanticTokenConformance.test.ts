/*
 * The whole semantic-token seam, driven in one process.
 *
 * Everything Milestones 3-6 build is a contract with a host this repo does not contain, and a
 * contract tested only against literal arrays is proved self-consistent rather than implementable.
 * This worker is the only server the repo controls, so this is the only test in either repo that
 * runs `initialize` -> request -> decode -> resolve -> registered highlight group with nothing
 * stubbed between the worker and the layer: real TypeScript, the narrow `createLanguageServerPlugin`
 * factory, a host-built `capabilities` block, the shipped `decodeSemanticTokens`, and a layer the
 * plugin created and handed over through its `semanticTokens` block.
 *
 * Two things here are not the real article, and neither of them sits on that path. The lib files
 * come off disk rather than the TypeScript playground CDN — Milestone 2's seam, because no suite of
 * ours may depend on the network — and the transport is a stub socket that hands the worker module's
 * own message handler the bytes a WebSocket would have carried, because a `Worker` needs a bundler
 * and the narrow factory speaks WebSocket only.
