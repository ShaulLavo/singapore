 * and the depth colour that refines it in turn, and must lose to an error squiggle and to the
 * current find match, which are both answers to a question the user just asked.
 *
 * Two rather than one because bracket depth colouring already held one, and a tie in this namespace
 * is resolved by registry insertion order — which is the defect the band exists to remove, not a
 * place to leave one. `packages/lsp-plugin/test/highlightPriority.test.ts` holds the whole order.
